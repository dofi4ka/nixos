I love idea of immutable OS where everithing is declared in one source of truth. But, I guess, it is quite impossible with linux.

I love ricing linux. There is a lot of software that I wanna try and nix doesn't really help me with that:
- I always need not only to read documentation of software X, but also read how software X is implemented in NixOS or in nix home-manager.
- Whenever I want to tweak even a bit of some software's config, I need to rebuild entire system, and even tho I usually need to restart software or entire system manually.
- A lot of implisit behavoir makes it quite hard to maintain configuration. I understand that NixOS' complexity makes it posible to create things like stylix, but even tho stylix works well only in specific cases.

NixOS may be very good OS for servers, where immutability and reproducibility are valued the most. But desktop experience kinda sucks right now.

Linux imperative by design: there was never a program, that exclusivly manages entire OS like nix does in NixOS. 

NixOS is ahead of its time.
